# Time-Series-Clustering
This is the implementation of a peper with this title , written by Pjotr Roelofsen.

I used DTW as a distance , Dynamic Time Warping(DTW) is a time series distance measure that is introduced in the field of data
mining to overcome some of the disadvantages of the Euclidean distance (Keogh and Ratanamahatana
(2004)). It warps two sequences x and y non-linearly in time in order to cope with time
deformations and varying speeds in time dependent data.

I also used Gap Statistics methods to find number of clusters
